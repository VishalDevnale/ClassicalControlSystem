# Seperately Excited DC Motor

## Objective: 

In last [experimentaion](https://github.com/VishalDevnale/ControlSystem/tree/master/ElectricMachines/DC_Motors/01_SeperatelyExcitedDCMotor/01_AbruptStart), we noticed energy lost is high for startup.
Here we are trying differnet startup mechanisim. Rotor is winding is energized after stator, NOT at the same time like previous experiment.

NOTE: Same concept is applicable to shunt DC motor: Refer to image:

Add snap here.

Simulate a sequential start-up with no series field excitation. This means that the “shunt” field winding is connected to rated voltage, then after a short waiting interval, the armature is connected to rated voltage. 

* What waiting interval do you recommend? 
* How much energy is lost taking this to steady state?
