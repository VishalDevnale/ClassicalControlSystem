# Self Balancing Robot #

Here self balancing robot rest position (i.e. stand up position) is controlled using LQR controller.

Before goint to control read the mathematical model of self balancing robot is [here](https://github.com/VishalDevnale/ControlSystem/tree/master/SelfBalancingRobot/01_SelfBalancingRobot_MathematicalModel.pdf)

Theory about the LQR can be found in this [PDF](https://github.com/VishalDevnale/ControlSystem/tree/master/CartPendulum/02_databook_ReadChapter8.pdf).  

Other control methods can be explored here: https://github.com/VishalDevnale/ControlSystem/tree/master/SelfBalancingRobot 

**Assumptions and Limitations:**
1. Full-state feedback is available. i.e. measured x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot is available.
2. Measurement noise or plant disturbances are not considered.
