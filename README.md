# ControlSystem
This repository contains different projects explaining the basic concepts of control system.

**Features:** 
1. Time response: initial, step, impulse
2. Frequency response: Bode and Nyquist plots
3. Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability margins, controllability, overshoot, settling time
4. Control design: eigenvalue placement, linear quadratic regulator, PID, MPC
5. Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter)

**Note:** These are just few examples whereas folders may contain more projects or concepts than mentioned here.

**Projects:**
1. Cart Pendulum
2. Two Wheeled Inverted Pendulum
3. Motor Control
