# ControlSystem
This repository contains different projects explaining the basic concepts of control system.

Control Systems:
1. PID
2. LQR
3. Feedforward control
4. MPC
5. Controllability, Robustness, Observability, Stead state error, Overshoot, Settling time

Note: These are just few examples whereas folders may contain more projects or concepts than mentioned here.

Projects:
1. Cart Pendulum
2. Two Wheeled Inverted Pendulum
3. Motor Control

Features: 
Time response: initial, step, impulse
Frequency response: Bode and Nyquist plots
Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability margins
Control design: eigenvalue placement, linear quadratic regulator
Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter)
